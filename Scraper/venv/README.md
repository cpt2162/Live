# Live

The Live web scraper is designed to visit various sites given a location and autonomously pull event information from that site. The number of sites visited will depend on the location as of now. The scraper is currently capable of taking a venue input and autonomously pull events happening there from LiveNation. As previously stated, the scraper is a work in progress; the goal is have the scraper be able to use the same functions for different sites while properly parsing all data correctly.
