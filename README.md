# Live

Live is intended to bring people together by making it easier than ever to find stuff to do, mainly live entertainment events such as concerts. Live's web scraper
periodically pulls event information autonomously from various websites of local venues, bars, clubs, etc. The goal is to get virtually everything happening in a
given location on one site that is easily accessible and shareable. Live will allow users to create friend groups to search and view event information for large 
groups to get together making sure no one misses a beat!

Currently, the web scraper is still in development and is included in this repository. No work for the Live site has been done.
